## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates an HTML file with the information of your engineering team members. The user is to input any number of team members (with ONE manager and any mix of engineers and interns) with appropriate data entries. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

## How to install dependencies

Please use: npm i

## Usage

Screenshot 1: The application firstly offers the user to input the information of the Manager. Input validation in place for names (number-proof), ID (integer-proof) and email address.
